    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transaction\n",
    "A transaction is an incoming or outgoing flow of money, defined by :\n",
    "- its amount\n",
    "- its date (date)\n",
    "- its description (description)\n",
    "- its nature (type)\n",
    "- its reason (category)\n",
    "- its group of similar transactions (group_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regularity from an expert point of view\n",
    "\n",
    "A transaction is considered regular if it is repeated at regular time intervals (the amount is not taken into account in the regularity algorithm). The objective is thus to identify weekly transactions (e.g.: purchase of tobacco every Saturday), bi-monthly transactions (e.g.: press subscription paid twice a month), monthly transactions (e.g.: receipt of salary at the beginning of the month), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time interval detected is referred to as the variable _frequency_. The frequency can take different values based on the mean interval:\n",
    "\"WEEK\", \"W-F\", \"FORTNIGHT\", \"F-M\", \"MONTH\", \"M-2M\", \"2MONTHS\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, some flexibility on the stability of the interval between 2 transactions should be taken in account to estimate the regularity. For example, if a salary falls on the first day of the first month, then again on the first day of the following month, and in the third month falls on the second day, the regularity is still considered to be monthly. Flexibility in the stability of the interval depends on the frequency: the higher the frequency (e.g. weekly transaction), the less deviation will be tolerated. Thus, a variation of 2 days for a monthly transaction is not significant, whereas it is for a transaction that would appear to be weekly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm\n",
    "In order to analyse the regularity of transactions, transactions are first grouped into clusters similar in description and amount. The groups of transactions are indicated by the variable _group_id_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "Follow the next steps to apply the algorithm on the attached data (transactions.csv). Then you will need to identify for the regularity algorithm in its alpha version at least :\n",
    "- a critical bug,\n",
    "- a negative tagging error (unidentified regular transactions), for which you will have to identify the possible reasons,\n",
    "- a positive labelling error (non-regular transactions labelled as regular), for which you should identify possible reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can play around with the data by deleting some rows, changing some variables, etc. in order to investigate the limits of the algorithm."
